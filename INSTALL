                    Installing O'Jacare 2 on a Unix machine
                    -------------------------------------

PREREQUISITES (INSTALLATION)

* The OCaml-java comiler from Xavier Clerc 
  (2.0-alpha-1 or newer recommended)
  URL : http://www.ocamljava.org/installation

* The ocamlfind tool findlib
  URL : http://projects.camlcity.org/projects/findlib.html

* The O'Caml distribution (4.01 or newer recommended)
  URL : http://caml.inria.fr/

* A Java SDK : JDK from Sun (1.7)
  URL : http://java.sun.com/
  Reports with newer JVM and JNI implemetations are welcome.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

2- Adjust the file 'Makefile.config' to your needs :
    * where to find O'Caml
    * where to install O'Jacare

3- From the top directory, do:

         make 

This build the O'Jacare code generator.

4- You can now install O'Jacare.

         make install

This will create the following commands 
(in the binary directory as set in Makefile.config) :

         ojacare       		the code generator

This will create the following library (in the library directory as set in 
Makefile.config)

	 Makefile.include	a makefile to help building with O'Jacare

5- To make some test, see directory examples/

6- Installation is complete. Time to clean up. From the top
directory, do "make -C src clean".


COMMON PROBLEMS:

* The Makefiles use the "include" directive, which is not supported by
all versions of make. Use GNU make if this is a problem.

* The Makefiles assume that make execute commands by calling /bin/sh. They
won't work if /bin/csh is called instead. You may have to unset the SHELL
environment variable, or set it to /bin/sh.
