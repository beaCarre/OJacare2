                    Installing O'Jacare on a Unix machine
                    -------------------------------------

PREREQUISITES

* The O'Caml distribution (3.06 or newer recommended)
  URL: http://caml.inria.fr/

* A Java SDK : O'Jacare have been tested with the JDK from Sun (1.4.2)
  URL : http://java.sun.com/
  Reporst with others JVM and JNI implemetations are welcome.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

1- Install the 'camljava' library from Xavier Leroy, with our patch.
   See INSTALL.camljava for furthers instructions.

2- Adjust the file 'Makefile.config' to your needs :
    * where to find O'Caml and the camljava library
    * where to install O'Jacare

3- From the top directory, do:

         make -C src depend
         make -C src byte
	 make -C src opt	# only if you build the native O'Caml compiler

This build the O'Jacare code generator, and helpers library.

4- You can now install O'Jacare. This will create the following commands 
(in the binary directory as set in Makefile.config) :

         ojacare       		the code generator

This will create the following library (in the library directory as set in 
Makefile.config)

	 jnihelpers.cma		some module used by code generated with ojacare
	 jnihelpers.cmxa		
	 jnihelpers.a		

	 Makefile.include	a makefile to help building with O'Jacare

From the top directory, become superuser and do:

        umask 022       # make sure to give read & execute permission to all
        make -C src install

5- To make some test, see directory examples/

6- Installation is complete. Time to clean up. From the toplevel
directory, do "make -C src clean".

COMMON PROBLEMS:

* The Makefiles use the "include" directive, which is not supported by
all versions of make. Use GNU make if this is a problem.

* The Makefiles assume that make execute commands by calling /bin/sh. They
won't work if /bin/csh is called instead. You may have to unset the SHELL
environment variable, or set it to /bin/sh.
