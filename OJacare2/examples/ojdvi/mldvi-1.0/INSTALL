PREREQUISITES
=============

You need Objective Caml 2.04 or higher to compile the sources.

You also need the `kpsewhich' utility of the `kpathsea' library
provided by many TeX distributions.


COMPILATION AND INSTALLATION
============================

Edit the Makefile if necessary, and compile with "make".
It creates a binary file "mldvi".

If your platform supports native compilation, you can also do
"make opt", which creates a (faster) binary "mldvi.opt"
(this is highly recommended).

Install the binary(ies) by hand, by simply copying it (them) to the
appropriate directories.
