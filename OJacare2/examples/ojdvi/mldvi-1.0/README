Mldvi is a simple DVI previewer written in Objective Caml.
(http://caml.inria.fr/ocaml/)

Version: 1.0 (first release)


CURRENTLY SUPPORTED FEATURES:
============================

- Antialiasing
- Color (as defined in the LaTeX package `color')
- Automatic recompilation of METAFONT fonts
- Automatic reloading of the file after modification

Notice that mldvi needs the `kpsewhich' tool in order to find and
recompile PK fonts.  (This program is part of the `kpathsea' library
provided by many TeX distributions.)


INVOCATION
==========

The invocation is

        mldvi [OPTIONS...] DVIFILE

where OPTIONS are:

  -geometry GEOM    sets the (maximum) geometry GEOM
  -g GEOM           same as -geometry GEOM
  -crop             crop the window to the best size (default)
  -no-crop          disable cropping
  -hmargin DIMEN    horizontal margin  (default: 1cm)
  -vmargin DIMEN    vertical margin    (default: 1cm)

Geometry GEOM is specified in pixels, using the standard format
for specifying geometries (i.e: "WIDTHxHEIGHT[+XOFFSET+YOFFSET]").

Dimensions (for options `-hmargin' and `-vmargin') are specified as
numbers optionaly followed by two letters representing units.

When no units are given, dimensions are treated as numbers of pixels.

Currently supported units are the standard TeX units as specified in
the TeXbook (D. Knuth, Addison-Wesley, (C) 1986):

  `pt' (point), `pc' (pica), `in' (inch), `bp' (big point),
  `cm' (centimeter), `mm' (millimeter), `dd' (didot point),
  `cc' (cicero) and `sp' (scaled point).

Notice that dimensions are specified w.r.t the original TeX document,
and do not correspond to what is actually shown on the screen, which
can be displayed at a different resolution than specified in the
original TeX source.


KEYSTROKES
==========

Mldvi recognizes the following keystrokes when typed in its window.
Each may optionally be preceded by a number, whose interpretation will
depend on the particular keystroke.

q      Quits the program

n      Moves to the next page (or to the n-th next page
       if a number is given)

p      Moves to the previous page (or back n pages).

g      Moves to the page with the given number.  The first page is
       numbered 1.

c      Center the page in the window, and resets the
       default resolution.

<      Scale the resolution by 1/1.414

>      Scale the resolution by 1.414

f      Load all the fonts used in the documents.  By default, fonts
       are loaded only when needed.

F      Does the same as `f', and precomputes the glyphs of all
       characters used in the document.  This takes more time than
       loading the fonts, but the pages are drawn faster.

Moreover, the user can drag the currently displayed page in the window
in order to change its relative position.  (This is useful when the
page is displayed at a resolution such that it cannot fit in the
window.)
